# eda_exploratory_data_analysis_in_python.py
This Python script performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset using powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It covers data inspection, missing value analysis, univariate, bivariate &amp; multivariate visualizations, and correlation analysis. 
# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python

This project demonstrates a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow using Python.  
EDA is the most important step in data science, helping you understand the dataset, detect patterns, identify outliers, visualize distributions, and find relationships between variables.

## 📌 About the Project
This script performs EDA on a dataset using the following steps:

- Importing required Python libraries  
- Loading the dataset  
- Understanding data shape, structure & summary  
- Checking missing values and duplicates  
- Univariate analysis (histograms, KDE plots, bar charts)  
- Bivariate analysis (swarm plots, pair plots, violin plots, box plots)  
- Multivariate analysis using correlation heatmaps  

These visualizations help reveal patterns and insights useful for further machine-learning modeling.
